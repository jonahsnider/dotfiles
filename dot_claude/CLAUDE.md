# CLAUDE.md

- When you're corrected by the user, consider if the feedback is generalizable enough to be added to a CLAUDE.md file
  - If yes, ask the user if a memory should be recorded in CLAUDE.md for future reference
- Keep changes simple, minimal impact and prefer lower complexity whenever possible
  - Do not add unrequested features, refactors, or abstractions
  - When given an example API or pattern to follow, match its simplicity closely
  - If a simple approach would actually be worse longterm, suggest a more complex approach and explain why the increased scope is better
- When working on a task, don't stop at planning or documentation, finish the implementation as well
  - If a plan is needed, keep it brief and move to code quickly unless the user explicitly asks for a plan only
